# Synchronization Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates various synchronization techniques in Java, including:

- Synchronized blocks and methods
- Deadlock scenarios and prevention
- Locks and condition variables
- Atomic variables

## Files
- `Main.java`: Entry point for running all demos.
- `SynchronizedDemo.java`: Demonstrates synchronized blocks and methods.
- `DeadlockDemo.java`: Simulates deadlock and prevention strategies.
- `LocksAndConditionsDemo.java`: Showcases usage of locks and condition variables.
- `AtomicVariablesDemo.java`: Illustrates atomic variables in multithreaded environments.

## Running the Demos
1. To run a specific demo, navigate to the respective file's `main` method and execute it.
2. Run  the `main`  method  in the Main.java  and choose a file to  run
